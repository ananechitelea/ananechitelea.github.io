Hello Bip we are in the last week of waiting...
It is hard I know but while we wait I think it is the best time to see how the BipPedia should be continued.

You can also use these as vouchers. Just screenshot the section where you see the word [VOUCHER] written in caps, print it using your little Bip printer, sign it, and then present it to the other Bip.

With that said the first voucher is:

VOUCHER_1 - MASSAGE DAY

The Bip is entitled to a massage day, which can be either a couples massage or a 2-hour home massage provided by the other Bip.
